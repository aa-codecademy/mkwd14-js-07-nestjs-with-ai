/**
 * Song entity — maps to the `song` table.
 *
 * Demonstrates THREE relations:
 *   - `artist`    → required `@ManyToOne` ("every song has a performer")
 *   - `album`     → optional `@ManyToOne` ("singles" exist before an album)
 *   - `playlists` → INVERSE `@ManyToMany` to `Playlist` (a song can appear
 *                   in many playlists; junction table is `playlist_songs`)
 *
 * It also shows two more `@Column` patterns:
 *   - `default: false` lets the DB assign a value when the client doesn't.
 *   - `nullable: true` on `albumId` so a song can exist without an album yet.
 *
 * TODO note in the original code: a Postgres `CHECK (durationSeconds > 0)`
 * constraint would belong here as `@Check("...")` from typeorm.

   *   - `songRepository.findOne({ where: { id }, relations: { playlists: true } })`

   *
   * Why this side is "inverse":
   *   - The owning side controls the junction table writes. From the song's
   *     point of view, playlist membership is a read-only graph view —
   *     adding/removing songs from a playlist goes through `PlaylistService`.
