/**
 * Song entity — maps to the `song` table.
 *
 * Demonstrates two `@ManyToOne` relations side by side:
 *   - `artist`  → required ("every song has a performer")
 *   - `album`   → optional ("singles" exist before being on an album)
 *
 * It also shows two more `@Column` patterns:
 *   - `default: false` lets the DB assign a value when the client doesn't.
 *   - `nullable: true` on `albumId` so a song can exist without an album yet.
 *
 * TODO note in the original code: a Postgres `CHECK (durationSeconds > 0)`
 * constraint would belong here as `@Check("...")` from typeorm.
